# MITJavaScript
# 1. Name: 
## MIT JavaScript Course releases  
# 2. Description: 
## This repository is intended to show you the advances that I will be achieving during my MIT JavaScript course. As part of the project, I will be uploading:
## - Coding assignments.
## - Simulations. 
## - Links to other resources of interest.  
# 3. Installation: 
## You will be able to launch the coding assignments in your browser and go through them with the Chrome console. If you want to edit them, I would recommend downloading VS Code editor to be able to create your own codes based on my experience.
# 4. Usage: 
## Feel free to use the codes as a start point to have basic examples of JavaScript coding. They are intended to grow on difficulty with time.
# 5. Support: 
## You can write me an email if you need any help to tfmeyer@inodu.com
# 6. Roadmap: 
## The repository will be updated weekly, according to the timelines of the course. Each week ends on wednesday, so you can expect the files to be uploaded up to friday.
